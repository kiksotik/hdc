# About the HDC-spec
The "HDC Protocol Specification", or ``HDC-spec``, for shorthand, is the formal definition of the HDC protocol.  
Its purpose is to ensure the interoperability of HDC implementations over a wide variety of platforms.  

The HDC protocol aims to become an [open-standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) for which  
the HDC-spec is intended to be the [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) 
of its specification.

This folder contains the most recently published [snapshot of HDC-spec](https://github.com/kiksotik/hdc/blob/main/doc/spec/HDC-spec.pdf), which 
is generated from the [living document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Htyat0OVi6-MFcNb1sEzKRlgkEb7jygx74PWdzXvG7w/edit?usp=sharing) that 
is authored collaboratively on Google docs.

> WARNING: The HDC-spec is currently being drafted and it's not meant yet to be deployed into productive environments!

### About the license of HDC-spec
- Note that the license above does only apply to the HDC-spec document.  
  The source-code published in the https://github.com/kiksotik/hdc repository 
  is licensed under the “MIT License”, instead. 


- The HDC protocol intends to become an open standard, and standards don't work well if everybody cooks its own variant.   
  I’ve nevertheless chosen a permissive license, because I believe that *the crowd* is sometimes better at 
  consolidating a standard, than a single individual is.  
  The authors of this standard will be more than happy to incorporate your proposed changes into this document.  
  Keep them coming via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kiksotik/hdc/issues).


- It would be greatly appreciated if any derivative work that modifies any of the conventions defined in HDC-spec would 
  also change the name of their protocol, as to avoid any potential confusion.
