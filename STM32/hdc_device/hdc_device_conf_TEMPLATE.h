// Buffer sizes to be allocated for the transmission of data.
// Must be at least 3 bytes larger than the longest reply that this device will be sending to any host.
// It's recommended to allow for larger TX buffers, because the hdc_device driver is able to compose
// multiple replies in a single buffer transfer to improve data throughput.
// ToDo: It's confusing, because actually two buffers of this size are being allocated:
//       While one is being transmitted via DMA, the other is used to continue composing new messages.
