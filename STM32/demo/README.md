# About

This folder contains STM32CubeIDE projects that demonstrate how HDC can be implemented on 
the [STM32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STM32) family of microcontrollers.

If it's your first time working with STM32CubeMX autogenerated project code: do not let it intimidate you! ;-)  
The actual demo code is only a tiny fraction of it and can be easily located by either searching for 
the "HDC" keyword, or simply look for files named ``feature_\*.c`` in the subfolder ``Core/Src/`` of a given project.

# Demo Overview

## Demo_Minimal_NUCLEO-F303RE  
Minimal example of how to implement HDC.  
You'll need a NUCLEO-F303RE prototyping board to run this demo. 

# HowTo

## How to set up your personal IDE "workspace"
The best way to explore, build, run and debug these demo projects, is by creating your own, personal 
STM32CubeIDE "workspace" directly in the ``STM32`` parent-folder and selectively "import" into it any 
of the demo projects you may want to try out.  
In STM32CubeIDE use the command ``File / Switch Workspace / Other...`` to relaunch the IDE with a 
dedicated "workspace" for this HDC repository.  
Note how ``.gitignore`` will exclude the ``.metadata`` folder of your personal "workspace" from this git repository.


## How to link to the hdc_device folder from demo projects 
*(Kind of a note to self and other contributors, because STM32CubeIDE can be a bit tricky to set up.)*  

Projects within ``STM32/demos/`` use a "linked folder" to reference the source-code contained in ``STM32/hdc_device/``. 
If the "project explorer" pane of the IDE does not show any ``MyDemoProject/Drivers/hdc_device`` folder, it might be 
because of the IDE's "Filter" settings hiding nested projects by default.
Deactivate the following checkbox to fix this:

When creating a new demo project, remember to:
* Right click on the ``MyDemoProject/Drivers/`` folder as shown in the project explorer of the IDE 
  and use ``New../ Folder / Advanced / LinkedFolder`` to reference the ``STM32/hdc_device/`` folder of this repository.
  
* Right click on ``MyDemoProject/Drivers/hdc_device/`` and use ``Add include path...`` 
  for the build system to be able to locate the header files contained therein.
